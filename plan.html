CP1406 - Assignment 1 - Project Plan

Name: Connor Bettini JC463119...

Goals:
The overall goal is to achieve a larger volleyball player base (by about 50%), focusing on both casual playing and the occasional professional competitions to try cater for everyones desires. This will be reached by making the site interesting and drawing the attention (aiming mostly at younger families) of people, hopefully getting them to sign up and come to a game or 2 to see if they like it or not. With more people attending Slammers Volleyball, the group will be able to make more money, have a larger player base (so more people of different talents etc) and overall, giving the company a more popular name, which would compliment the rising popularity that is being shown towards volleyball. Since the venue is available to hire for functions, giving the company a more popular name will boost the amount of people hiring it, also providing for them. An increase in Fun, Family, Fitness is the main overall goal of  the website's creation. <br>

Success Evaluation:
An easy way to measure whether or not the site is being put to use, is to find out how many people have signed up online since it's creation, giving the client a good idea whether or not it  was a successful investment. 
...

Target Audience:
The site is intended for a younger audience (around 15-30 year olds), trying to introduce volleyball to them at a younger age, although it can also vary (with up to 50 year olds) as this is a family sport. The site was designed with the intention to grab the attention of younger people with action images of the sport and with the use of colour psychology, using warmer and more inviting colours (which also correspond with the beach and ocean) like blues and whites. It's also easy to use and shouldn't be hard to follow for anyone.
